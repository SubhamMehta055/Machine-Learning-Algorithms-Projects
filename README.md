# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Projects

### In this repository I have added all the ipynb files which I have done practically to get the sense of each model whether its of Supervised or UnSupervised Category. From Data selection to EDA to Feautre Engineering to Model selection to Training to Testing to Predicting i have done successfully and evaluated each model by fine-tuning the Hyperparameters of each model. So by this I have achieved good accuracy on test data while prediciting or classifying or Clustering.
